# **Simple Visualization of Machine Learning model with TensorBoard**

### **What is TensorBoard**?

[TensorBoard](https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard) provides the visualization and tooling needed for machine learning experimentation. it's very useful for monitoring of modelâ€™s training process. 

In this example, we are going to use TensorBoard to visualize and track metrics such as Loss and accuracy of a model.

### **How to use TensorBoard**

1. *Import TensorBoard* 

   ```python
   from tensorflow.python.keras.callbacks import TensorBoard
   import time
   ```

2. *After the model definition instantiate TensorBoard and specify a log directory where events will be saved for visualization.*

   ```python
   tensorboard = Tensorboard('log_dir/{}'.format(time.time()))
   ```

3. In the fit function, tell Keras to call back to the TensorBoard by specifying the Callback parameter using the instance of  the TensorBoard.

   ```python
   model.fit(x_train,y_train, epochs=10, callbacks=[tensorboard])
   ```

4. In your Terminal execute the tensorboard command pointing to the log directory you specified. It will execute and gives a localhost address, copy and access the address in a browser to visualize  the training process. You can also view the graph that was built for the training.

   ```python
   >>tensorboard --logdir="specify_path_to_your_log_directory"
   ```
